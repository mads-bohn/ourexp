# Our Experience
Our Experience is a web application created as a social experiment, designed to connect strangers with similar emotions and experiences. It allows users to create journal entries and tag them with feelings. On submission, the application displays journal entries from other users with the same feelings.
By getting a rare peek into other people's most honest thoughts, users can feel less alone in their experiences.
